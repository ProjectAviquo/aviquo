MLH recently launched a program known as MLH fellowship which is a 12-week remote program where students collaborate on Open Source projects that align their personal interests with the general requirements of the industry and students can participate from their homes. It has mainly three tracks – Software Engineering, Open Source, and Production Engineering. Here you will gain those skills that you require to be a successful engineer like writing good documentation, open-source best practices, communication, etc. Also, make sure you meet the eligibility criteria before applying for the program.",

It is sort of a remote internship of 3 months and only a handful number of students are selected across the world. The Outreachy internship projects focus on programming, documentation, project marketing, etc. During the application process, you need to show some genuine eagerness that why you want to be an Outreachy intern and in turn, what you’re going to accomplish, and then how you plan to promote diversity and all sorts of things. It is a paid internship in which you are paid an amount of 7000 USD.",

    "description": "GirlScript Summer of Code is the 3 month-long Open Source program during summers conducted by GirlScript Foundation, started in 2018, with an aim to help beginners get started with Open Source Development while encouraging diversity. Throughout the program, participants contribute to different projects under the guidance of experienced mentors. Top participants get exciting goodies and opportunities.\r\n\r\nApart from these, there are several universities, and institutes that organize their own SoC programs to encourage newcomers.\r\n\r\nE.g. NJACK Winter of Code by Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, KWoC by Kharagpur Open Source Society, IIT Kharagpur (KOSS), BOSS – Bountiful Open Source Summer by Coding Blocks, etc.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to wait for a particular program to start in order to contribute to open source. So it is not like when Google Summer of Code will open up applications that will be the only time you can contribute. If you know a particular tech stack you can start right NOW!! And most importantly, open-source is not something that you do for a stipend. You do it to make an impact, it should be your passion. True “open-source contributors” find the idea of creating value for people and impacting the world through their work gratifying.",
